# How To Contribute
Clone this repo or a fork of this repo, and make your changes locally. You can test locally with the command `npm run start`, which will automatically clean and rebuild with your changes, then run the program. 

## Testing
Ideally, changes which alter the output or behavior of the program need at least one new unit test added. If you change a fundamental aspect of the program, please also update the usage and README to reflect the new behavior.

## Merging
Open a pull request against `dev` with a clear title, and a short description of why and how the changes were made. If your branch is up to date, and all the unit tests pass, it will be reviewed and merged.
